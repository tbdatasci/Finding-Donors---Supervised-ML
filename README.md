# Finding-Donors---Supervised-ML
This is an example of several categorical machine learning algorithms.  The point is to predict who will donate.  I did this using naive bayes, adaboost, and logistic regression.  Finally, I used grid search with Adaboost in order to find the optimal parameters for the Adaboost algorithm.
